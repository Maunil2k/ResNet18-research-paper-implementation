# ResNet18 Research Paper Implementation

This repository shows the implementation of research paper: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition using tensorflow. Further, the model was trained on simple binary classification problem, classifying cats and dogs. The training results have been uploaded as well in the CSV file. The loss chart and accuracy chart for the same can be seen below.<br /><br />
